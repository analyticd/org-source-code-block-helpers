;;; Commentary:

;; Various helpers to efficiently work with org-mode source
;; blocks.
;;
;; User API:
;; M-x osbh:insert-org-src-code-block to create a brand new source block.
;; M-x osbh:enclose-region-in-src-code-block to enclose a region in a source
;; code block.
;; M-x osbh:add-additional-org-src-block-properties to add source code block
;; babel language if missing and other properties.
;;
;; NOTE Each command above requires the point (cursor) to be anywhere on the
;; same line as the #+BEGIN_SRC or #+begin_src directive when the command is
;; executed. The user is warned with an error message if this is not the
;; case.
;;
;; See README for additional details.
